Here is its monument to the men who fought and died in the war and here, periodically, the citizens pay homage. The General Post Office is the main feature of the short street, and all the buildings are of sound construction, especially the State Savings Bank ( right foreground), in which a great quantity of marble has been used and which is one of Australia's outstanding architectural features. No visitor to Australia should miss seeing the interior of this bank. Sydney is the largest city in the Commonwealth, with a population of more than 1, 000,000, and for beauty and attraction its harbour and surf beaches are unsurpassed.

Information on back of photograph: ""On the slopes of Mt. Kosciusko (7,328 feet above sea level and highest mountain in Australia), snow lies deep for almost six months of the year, giving some of the finest and safest skiing country in the world. Experts stay at the modern chalet at Charlotte Pass skiing on the Main Range and near Kosciusko's summit, while novices are instructed on the nursery slopes around Hotel Kosciusko. In summer, visitors can enjoy trail-riding to five alpine lakes, trout-fishing in 100 miles of well-stocked snow fed streams, or gold or tennis.""
